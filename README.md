Got it â€” I can make you a **README.md** that explains the project, whatâ€™s included, and how to run it.
Since the repo is based on the Catlike Coding Unity hex map tutorial but is incomplete, Iâ€™ll word it so itâ€™s clear itâ€™s a work in progress.

Hereâ€™s a draft:

# Empire Ascendancy: Conquest of Nations (Incomplete)

A Unity-based hex map strategy game project inspired by the [Catlike Coding Hex Map tutorial](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/hex-map/).  
This repository contains the **incomplete** game code with additional comments and notes for learning and reference purposes.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

The aim of this project is to create a **turn-based, hex map-based strategy game** where players manage nations, expand territory, and engage in strategic warfare.

Currently, this project is in **early development** and follows the structure of the Catlike Coding tutorial, with some customizations and personal commentary to aid learning.

## ðŸ›  Features (Current)

- Unity-based **hexagonal tile grid** generation
- Basic terrain rendering and chunk handling
- Code heavily commented for educational purposes

## ðŸš§ Planned Features

- Procedural terrain generation with multiple terrain types
- Turn-based resource management and combat
- Diplomacy and AI-controlled nations
- UI elements for managing the playerâ€™s empire
